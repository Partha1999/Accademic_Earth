        <p>
          Ans:Since we are teaching from scratch. So you don't need to know anything beforehand. But if you have time, you can do these three things.1. You need to keep some brain space to get the things in your head after watching the video. 2. Just joining the course will not make you an auto web developer. Must have a hard-working, stick-to-it mentality. 3. If you get stuck somewhere, you have to have the mentality of asking for help and the will to stick around.
